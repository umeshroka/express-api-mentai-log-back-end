# Express API Mentai Log Back End

## Description

During the ideation period, we knew that we wanted to incorporate some sort of AI technology into our app. 
Initially, we wanted to something with visionAI either video or image but we feared that it would take too much time, effort and money hence, we decided to go with something simple like sentiment analysis technology which is quite mature by now. 

This is a journal app, not quite a mental health app. We thought doing a full mental health app would be too sensitive and risk with mistakes and errors would be too great hence, we decided to go with a simple journal app with sentiment analysis for self monitoring. The name reflects the playful nature of the app with a play on mental health and a popular food item: mentai and logging. 

Essentially, the user logs a written journal everyday. The app analyses the journal for emotions such as joy, sadness etc, sentiment, keywords and entities. These are stored in the databased and is presented as a visualisation in the user's dashboard back to the user. This way, the user can monitor their mood and things that are bothering them.

## Stretch Goals

Incorporate search in the loglist. Allows the user to look back and search for logs.

We want to have dynamic feedback to the user based on their mood trends using LLM which has been prompted to provide safe, proven and professional advice. Or we can hardcode some feedback.

It would be good if we could give the user an option to do video journalling on top of the text journalling. This way, the user can choose the medium that they are most comfortable with. Video journalling would be superior for us because we could potentially monitor the facial features to extract sentiments because pictures paint a better picture than what people say or write. But this would involve a lot of work because it entails incorporating visionAI as well as speech to text. Not sure if we have the skillset to do this yet.
